# Standards (WIP)

Common standards and guidelines for Code for Australia repositories.


## Why Standards 

At Code for Australia we believe in Open Source. One of our philosophies is to "Keep it Open by Default". 

This repository contains some basic guidelines to help Fellows set up good Open Source projects. 

We also recommend reading the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/).

### Adding a Readme

Write your own or use the [README template](https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/standards/blob/master/templates/README.md) as a guide.

The branded Readme also links to Code for Australia's Code of Conduct and Contributing documents.

  
### Adding a License 

Choose one that is right for your project, if you're not sure you probably want to use an [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit).
