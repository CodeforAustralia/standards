### Adding a Readme

Write your own or use the [README template](https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/standards/blob/master/templates/README.md) as a guide.

The branded Readme also links to Code for Australia's Code of Conduct and Contributing documents.

  
### Adding a License 

Choose one that is right for your project, if you're not sure you probably want to use an [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit).
